# Keep

Listen for her to say anything she wants. Write it down in Google Keep. Tag note with #{{HerName}} and #Food or #Gift. Look it up later when you want to get her a #Food or #Gift. Brains are bad at notes... just write it down.

# Trello

Make a shared trello. Create lists titled 'date night' and 'gifts' for her to populate for you.
